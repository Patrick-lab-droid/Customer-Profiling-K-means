ðŸ‘¥ K-Means Customer Profiling

This project applies K-Means clustering to perform customer profiling and segmentation. Data preprocessing is handled with Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, including scaling, encoding, and dimensionality reduction with PCA. Clustering performance is evaluated using the silhouette score, while insights are visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The workflow demonstrates how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden patterns in customer data to support targeted marketing and data-driven decision-making.
